# Your Next Hire
I'm an expert developer with a Bachelors in Software Design & Development. Real intellegence, nothing artifical.

Over the years I've adapted a wide variety of development frameworks and languages, and I've lead multiple projects to completion.
## Leadership
I've lead multiple small teams to develop projects in a variety of different programming languages.

## Web Development
Both solo and with a team, I've built many webapps and sites in a variety of languages and frameworks. From React to Express with Handlebars, from NodeJS to DotNET, even writing a webserver in Java. From leveraging Bootstrap, MKDocs, or writing HTML, CSS, and JS entirely from scratch. I've hosted sites everywhere from Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Firebase, Digital Ocean, to self hosted on baremetal.

## Game Development
I've worked in UnityEngine for years now, and I'm actively branching my skills off into Godot to future-proof my creations.

## Virtual Reality
I've been a regular user of VR games and social networks and hope to make a career connecting people across the globe in immersive VR Experiences.

I've been a regular creator in VRChat for some years now, and aim to expand my creations accross multiple platforms. I've even built my own private advertising network in VRChat.
